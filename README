===================
xSYGVIC Readme File
===================

-------------------------------
Test Run of the xSYGVIC package
-------------------------------
* To test the xSYGVIC package, just type:
  ./test

  If all work correctly (compile, execution ..), file ``out.txt''
  will be generated in the same directory. It reports the test cases
  and computed results. 

* If necessary, you need to change the permission of 'test' 
  to make it executable: 
  chmod 755 test

-----------------------
BLAS and LAPACK Library
-----------------------
* If BLAS and LAPACK are not installed on your machine, type 'make' will 
  generate the LAPACK library with the associated LAPACK files in the 
  directory 'lapacklib'.

* For better performance, if BLAS and LAPACK are available on your machine,
  say Intel's MKL, modify 'make.inc' to specify:
  (1) LAPACK_DIR
  (2) LAPACK_LIB
  and comment the line:
  LAPACK_LIB = $(MAIN_DIR)/liblapack.a

--------
Compiler
--------
* Install 'gfortran' if there is not fortran compiler on your machine.
  On Ubuntu, type:
  sudo apt-get install gfortran

* If Intel's MKL is to be used, change the complier from 'gfortran' 
  to 'ifort' in the file 'make.inc'.

------------------------
Run individual test case
------------------------
* The main test routine is 'tstdsygvic.f90' in the directory /example.

* After successfully compiling the package, a test execution file named
  'tstdsygvic' will be generated in /example.

* To simply run the test /example, type:
  ./tstdsygvic Aname Bname output
  where Aname and Bname are names of the matrix files, and
  output is the name of the output file.

--------------------------
Format of the Input Matrix
--------------------------
* The first line of matrix file specify the order of the matrix, and the
  following lines are the data of the matrix.
